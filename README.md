# Predicting-Customer-Churn

As a part of our machine learning course in MSBA, my team (Shalini Mishra, Shivani Sharma and Japsowin Kaur) and I worked on building a model for predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. We used a kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
Key steps for building the model:
  1. Data preprocessing
  2. Algorithms tried: Simple logistic regression, PCR, Random Forest, KNN Classification, k-means clustering and regression for each            cluster
We got the best results with k-means clustering followed by simple logistic regression for each cluster. Each cluster formed a customer segment with distinct characteristics
I was repsonsible for PCR, k-means clustering and logistic regression. Post which I identified the customer segments, key differentiators among custoemr segments and business recommendations for each segment to reduce churn
